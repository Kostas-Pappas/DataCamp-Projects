Loading the NIPS papers\n<p>The NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems) is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community. At each NIPS conference, a large number of research papers are published. Over 50,000 PDF files were automatically downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. These NIPS papers are stored in <code>datasets/papers.csv</code>. The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!). These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more.\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/project_158/img/nips_logo.png\" alt=\"The logo of NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems)\"></p>\n<p>First, we will explore the CSV file to determine what type of data we can use for the analysis and how it is structured. A research paper typically consists of a title, an abstract and the main text. Other data such as figures and tables were not extracted from the PDF files. Each paper discusses a novel technique or improvement. In this analysis, we will focus on analyzing these papers with natural language processing methods.</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>year</th>\n      <th>title</th>\n      <th>event_type</th>\n      <th>pdf_name</th>\n      <th>abstract</th>\n      <th>paper_text</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1987</td>\n      <td>Self-Organization of Associative Database and ...</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>1-self-organization-of-associative-database-an...</td>\n      <td>Abstract Missing</td>\n      <td>767\\n\\nSELF-ORGANIZATION OF ASSOCIATIVE DATABA...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>1987</td>\n      <td>A Mean Field Theory of Layer IV of Visual Cort...</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>10-a-mean-field-theory-of-layer-iv-of-visual-c...</td>\n      <td>Abstract Missing</td>\n      <td>683\\n\\nA MEAN FIELD THEORY OF LAYER IV OF VISU...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>100</td>\n      <td>1988</td>\n      <td>Storing Covariance by the Associative Long-Ter...</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>100-storing-covariance-by-the-associative-long...</td>\n      <td>Abstract Missing</td>\n      <td>394\\n\\nSTORING COVARIANCE BY THE ASSOCIATIVE\\n...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>1000</td>\n      <td>1994</td>\n      <td>Bayesian Query Construction for Neural Network...</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>1000-bayesian-query-construction-for-neural-ne...</td>\n      <td>Abstract Missing</td>\n      <td>Bayesian Query Construction for Neural\\nNetwor...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>1001</td>\n      <td>1994</td>\n      <td>Neural Network Ensembles, Cross Validation, an...</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>1001-neural-network-ensembles-cross-validation...</td>\n      <td>Abstract Missing</td>\n      <td>Neural Network Ensembles, Cross\\nValidation, a...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>","text/plain":"     id  year                                              title event_type  \\\n0     1  1987  Self-Organization of Associative Database and ...
