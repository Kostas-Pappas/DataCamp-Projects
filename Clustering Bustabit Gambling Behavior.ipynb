{"cells":[{"source":"## 1. A preliminary look at the Bustabit data\n<p>The similarities and differences in the behaviors of different people have long been of interest, particularly in psychology and other social science fields. Understanding human behavior in particular contexts can help us to make informed decisions. Consider a game of poker - understanding why players raise, call, and fold in various situations can provide a distinct advantage competitively.</p>\n<p>Along these lines, we are going to focus on the behavior on <strong>online gamblers</strong> from a platform called <a href=\"https://www.bustabit.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bustabit</a>. There are a few basic rules for playing a game of Bustabit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You bet a certain amount of money (in Bits, which is 1 / 1,000,000th of a Bitcoin) and you win if you cash out before the game <strong>busts</strong>.</li>\n<li>Your win is calculated by the multiplier value at the moment you cashed out. For example, if you bet 100 and the value was 2.50x at the time you cashed out, you win 250. In addition, a percentage <code>Bonus</code> per game is multiplied with your bet and summed to give your final <code>Profit</code> in a winning game. Assuming a <code>Bonus</code> of 1%, your <code>Profit</code> for this round would be <code>(100 x 2.5) + (100 x .01) - 100 = 151</code></li>\n<li>The multiplier increases as time goes on, but if you wait too long to cash out, you may bust and lose your money.</li>\n<li>Lastly, the house maintains slight advantages because in 1 out of every 100 games, everyone playing busts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Below we see an example of a winning game:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_643/img/bustabit_win.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>And a losing game, for comparison:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_643/img/bustabit_loss.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Our goal will be to define relevant <strong>groups</strong> or <strong>clusters</strong> of Bustabit users to identify what patterns and behaviors of gambling persist. Can we describe a particular group as risk-averse? Is there a set of gamblers that have a strategy that seems to be more successful in the long term?</p>\n<p>The data you will be working with includes over 40000 games of Bustabit by a bit over 4000 different players, for a total of 50000 rows (one game played by one player). The data includes the following variables:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Id</strong> - Unique identifier for a particular row (game result for one player)</li>\n<li><strong>GameID</strong> - Unique identifier for a particular game</li>\n<li><strong>Username</strong> - Unique identifier for a particular player</li>\n<li><strong>Bet</strong> - The number of Bits (1 / 1,000,000th of a Bitcoin) bet by the player in this game</li>\n<li><strong>CashedOut</strong> - The multiplier at which this particular player cashed out</li>\n<li><strong>Bonus</strong> - The bonus award (in percent) awarded to this player for the game</li>\n<li><strong>Profit</strong> - The amount this player won in the game, calculated as (Bet * CashedOut) + (Bet * Bonus) - Bet</li>\n<li><strong>BustedAt</strong> - The multiplier value at which this game busted</li>\n<li><strong>PlayDate</strong> - The date and time at which this game took place</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's begin by doing an exploratory dive into the Bustabit data!</p>","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":["context"],"deletable":false,"dc":{"key":"4"},"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true}}},{"execution_count":2,"source":"# Load the

To begin to assess the quality and distinctiveness of these groups, we are going to look at <strong>group averages</strong> for each cluster across the original variables in our clustering dataset.

Visualize the clusters with a Parallel Coordinate Plot\n<p>We can already learn a bit about our cluster groupings by looking at the previous table. We can clearly see that there is a group that makes very large bets, a group that tends to cash out at very high multiplier values, and a group that has played many games of Bustabit. We can visualize these group differences graphically using a Parallel Coordinate Plot or PCP. To do so, we will introduce one more kind of scaling: min-max scaling, which forces each variable to fall between 0 and 1.</p>\n<p>Other choices of scaling, such as the Z-score method from before, can work effectively as well. However, min-max scaling has the advantage of <strong>interpretability</strong> - a value of 1 for a particular variable indicates that cluster has the highest value compared to all other clusters, and a value of 0 indicates that it has the lowest. This can help make relative comparisons between the clusters more clear.</p>\n<p>The <code>ggparcoord()</code> function from <code>GGally</code> will be used to produce a Parallel Coordinate Plot. Note that this has a built-in argument <code>scale</code> to perform different scaling options, including min-max scaling.

Visualize the clusters with Principal Components\n<p>One issue with plots like the previous is that they get more unwieldy as we continue to add variables.

Essentially, this is a two-stage process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We extract the principal components in order to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset so that we can produce a scatterplot in two dimensions that captures the underlying structure of the higher-dimensional data.</li>\n<li>We then produce a scatterplot of each observation (in this case, each player) across the two Principal Components and color according to their cluster assignment in order to visualize the separation of the clusters.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This plot provides interesting information in terms of the similarity of any two players. In fact, you will see that players who fall close to the boundaries of clusters might be the ones that exhibit the gambling behavior of a couple of different clusters.

Analyzing the groups of gamblers our solution uncovered\n<p>Though most of the statistical and programmatical work has been completed, possibly the most important part of a cluster analysis is to interpret the resulting clusters. This often is the most desired aspect of the analysis by clients, who are hoping to use the results of your analysis to inform better business decision making and actionable items. As a final step, we'll use the parallel coordinate plot and cluster means table to interpret the Bustabit gambling user groups! Roughly speaking, we can breakdown the groups as follows:</p>\n<p><strong><p style=\"color:#d95f02\">Cautious Commoners:</p></strong> This is the largest of the five clusters, and might be described as the more casual Bustabit players. They've played the fewest number of games overall, and tend to make more conservative bets in general. </p>\n<p><strong><p style=\"color:#66a61e\">Strategic Addicts:</p></strong> These users play a lot of games on Bustabit, but tend to keep their bets under control. As a result, they've made on average a net positive earnings from the site, in spite of having the most games played. They seem to maintain a strategy (or an automated script/bot) that works to earn them money.</p>\n<p><strong><p style=\"color:#7570b3\">Risky Commoners:</p></strong> These users seem to be a step above the Cautious Commoners in their Bustabit gambling habits, making larger average bets, and playing a larger number of games on the site. As a result, though they have about the same number of average games won as the Risk Takers, they have a significantly higher number of games lost.</p>\n<p><strong><p style=\"color:#1b9e77\">Risk Takers: </p></strong> These users have played only a couple games on average, but their average cashed out value is significantly higher than the other clusters, indicating that they tend to wait for the multiplier to increase to large values before cashing out.</p>\n<p><strong><p style=\"color:#e7298a\">High Rollers:</p></strong> High bets are the name of the game for this group. They bet large sums of money in each game, although they tend to cash out at lower multipliers and thus play the game more conservatively, particularly compared to the Risk Takers. Interestingly, these users have also on average earned a net positive earnings from their games played.</p>","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":["context"],"deletable":false,"dc":{"key":"60"},"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true}}},{"execution_count":null,"source":"# Assign cluster names to clusters 1 through 5 in order\ncluster_names <- c(\n    \"Risky Commoners\",\n    \"\",\n    \"\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Strategic Addicts\"\n)\n\n# Append the cluster names to the cluster means table\nbustabit_clus_avg_named <- bustabit_clus_avg %>%\n    cbind(Name = ....)\n\n# View the cluster means table with your appended cluster names\nbustabit_clus_avg_named","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"trusted":true,"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"60"}}}],"nbformat_minor":2,"nbformat":4,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"R","name":"ir","display_name":"R"},"language_info":{"file_extension":".r","pygments_lexer":"r","version":"3.4.1","name":"R","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","codemirror_mode":"r"}}}
