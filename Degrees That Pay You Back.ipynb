Which college majors will pay the bills?\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/project_584/img/salary.png\" width=\"400\" align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>Wondering if that Philosophy major will really help you pay the bills? Think you're set with an Engineering degree? Choosing a college major is a complex decision evaluating personal interest, difficulty, and career prospects. Your first paycheck right out of college might say a lot about your salary potential by mid-career. Whether you're in school or navigating the postgrad world, join me as we explore the short and long term financial implications of this <em>major</em> decision.</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we'll be using data collected from a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc., made available <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-Degrees_that_Pay_you_Back-sort.html?mod=article_inline\">here</a> by the Wall Street Journal for their article <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121746658635199271\">Ivy League's Big Edge: Starting Pay</a>. After doing some data clean up, we'll compare the recommendations from three different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, apply a k-means clustering analysis, and visualize the results.</p>\n<p>To begin, let's prepare by loading the following packages: <code>tidyverse</code>, <code>dplyr</code>, <code>readr</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, <code>cluster</code>, and <code>factoextra</code>. We'll then import the data from <code>degrees-that-pay-back.csv</code> (which is stored in a folder called <code>datasets</code>), and take a quick look at what we're working with.</p>","metadata":{"run_control":{"frozen":true},"deletable":false,"tags":["context"],"dc":{"key":"4"},"editable":false},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[{"text":"Parsed with column
